# Week 1 Milestone: Use Cases

For this project, I am creating an app that would detect a cognate in English or in Spanish.

A cognate is a type of word that shares a similar meaning, spelling and pronunciation with a
word from another language. These words usually have the same origin, this is the reason why
they have all the mentioned similarities.

Some cognates are called true cognates, words that are spelled identically, and have the same
meaning. This would include words like “radio/*radio*”, “animal/*animal*”, “banjo/*banjo*”, etc.
There are also false cognates or false friends, these are words that are spelled identically, but do
not have the same meaning. An example of this is the word “pie” in English, which is a pastry
and the word “*pie*” in Spanish, which means foot.

The first case is to identify if a word is a true cognate or a false one. 

The second case would be, in the situation where the user types a word that does not have a cognate into the app, such as “doll”,
the system will return the output, “This word has no cognate.” Since, the system would not have
found the word in its database.
